    "# Proposal On Low Risk Aircraft Purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal aims to generate insights for business stakeholders in a company diversifying its portfolio into the aviation industry. Given the extensivess of the data sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board from 1962 on civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters, this proposal will focus on the data from 2000 onwards. This will provide a great balance between being recent enough to reflect modern technology and safety regulations as well as long enough to capture meaningful data relating to the accidents/incidents. The proposal looks at various\n",
    "relationships present in the data such as engine type and incidences of fatal injuries which feed into the business recommendations centered around purchase of aircrafts which will lead to reduced liability for the company. Finally, the report concludes highlighting additional considerations not present in the proposal that the company needs to take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposal is split into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Problem\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Methodology\n",
    "4. Business Recommendation\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A company is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but does not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. This proposal will aim to determine which models of aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor as well as translate findings into actionable insights that the company's head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data used for this analysis is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 on civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. This data can be found in `AviationData.csv`.\n",

    "From the graph above,there were a lot more aviation accidents/incidents observed in the 1980s to the late 1990s which resulted in higher fatal and serious injuries. This trend seems to have changed at the turn of the millenium. There could have been an implementation of major safety regulations which saw a major shift in air safety culture following high profile crashes. Similarly from the trend of the total uninjured below, we see a lot more spikes in the 1980s and 1990s as opposed to the post 2000 period. This implies there have been less aviation accidents/incidents in the post 2000 period which corroborates our findings as aforementioned. "

    "As can be observed,  the **turbo fan** engine had the highest number of uninjured persons while the **reciprocating** engine had the lowest number. On the other hand, in terms of fatalities, the **turbo prop** engine had the highest number of fatal injuries with the **turbo jet** having the least number. Thus, it does seem engine type goes a long way in determining the number of fatal injuries. Engines with a higher safety record tend to have lower fatal injuries. These engines, such as the turbo fan, would be the most preferred option for a company getting into the industry to reduce it's initial liability.\n",

    "From the graphs above, we can see that the relationship is much more clearer this time around when compared to the engine type comparisons. Aircrafts with three engines had the highest number of uninjured persons and no total fatal injuries. On the other hand, aircraft with one engine had the leading number of total fatal injuries with the minimum number of uninjured persons. Thus, the company needs to ensure that they go for a plane with the number of engines that reduces the number of fatal injuries, in this case that would be planes with three engines.  \n",

    "## Business Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The business recommendations are based on the data provided and the analysis done on the data. Please note other considerations such as purchase cost, servicing costs, insurance costs and maintenance history will not be not taken into account as they were no present in the data used for this analysis. The recommendations are centered on passenge safety and reduced liability to the company in the event of an accident/incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the business recommendations based on the data analysis performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engine Type**: The company should go for an aircraft with a turbo fan engine. From the analysis, this is the safest engine with the highest number of persons uninjured following an aviation incident/accident. Even though it wasn't the lowest in terms of fatal injuries, there was a really small difference observed when compared with the engine with the least fatal injuries, the turbo jet engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No of Engines**: The company should invest in an aircraft that has 3 engines. We have seen from the analysis that this is the engine that offers the perfect combination i.e has the lowest number of fatal injuries and the highest number of uninjured persons in the event of an accident/incident. As a company making an entry into the aviation industry, this would limit its liability and minimize the probability of huge payoffs in the event of an accident/incident.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Airline business**: In terms of which flying business to venture in, the company has few options listed below:\n",
    "         - Business\n",
    "         - Positioning\n",
    "         - Executive/Corporate\n",
    "         - Aerial Application\n",
    "Main reason behind these choices is that the planes that meeet the first two business recommendations tend to operate in these businesses. Given the company is a new entrant to the aviation industry and the scope of the data used in the analysis, it would be prudent to observe and research on these different flying business ventures from existing players to determine which of the above choices would suit it the best. Also, these ventures were observed to have lower fatal injuries when compared to other line of businesses such as planes for personal hire or skydiving. \n",

    "\n",
    "The proposal has looked at civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters from 2000 to 2023 to determine the models of aircrafts that are the lowest risk for a company to venture into the aviation industry with. Engine type and number of engines were found to influence the number of total fatal injuries following an accident/incident. Aircrafts with turbo fan engine type and three engines were observed to be the lowest risk. The purpose of flying on the other hand, showed that personal flying was the leading cause of a lot of fatal injuries. Thus, the company is open to trying different airline businesses such as Business, Positioning, Executive/Corporate, Aerial applications. The proposal determined eight aircraft models under the Dassault Aviation, Mcdonnell Douglas and Dassault-Breguet makes which were low risk aircrafts ideal for the company to purchase. Choice of model would be influenced by the line of business the company intends to venture into. Finally, there are additional considerations that the company needs to take into account which have not been touched on in this proposal, due to data limitations, such as purchase cost, servicing costs, servicing history, insurance costs as well as localising the data to the business environment that the company intends to operate in.
